# Dropbox

The Dropbox plugin allows Omeka Classic users to load files into a folder on their server (with
SFTP, FTP, SSH, or other similar options), then from there add them to their Omeka site. This
enables users to batch upload many files at once, or upload files that are too large for the
normal upload limit.
